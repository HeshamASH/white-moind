 It’s free to use PayPal to pay for a purchase or any other type of commercial transaction unless it 
involves a currency conversion.
 Buying with PayPal
 Online or in-store
Rate
 No Fee (when no currency conversion is involved)
 Selling with PayPal
 When you buy or sell goods or services, make any other commercial type of transaction, send or 
receive a charity donation or receive a payment when you “request money” using PayPal, we call 
that a “commercial transaction”.
 For the listings of selling rates, please visit our 
PayPal Merchant Fees Page.
 Sending and receiving payments
 When you send funds (initiated from the “Friends and Family” tab of the “Send” flow) to, or receive 
funds into your PayPal account from, friends and family without making an underlying commercial 
transaction (that is, the payment is not for the purchase of goods or services or for making any 
other commercial transaction), we call that a “personal transaction”.
 Personal transactions are limited in availability and may not be available in some markets. If you 
use your credit card as the payment method for a personal transaction, you may be charged a 
cash-advance fee by your credit card company.
 The rates relating to personal transactions are set out below.

 the fee amount from your sending balance into the currency in which the fee is payable, in which case the fees for “Currency
 Conversions” also apply. If you use another payment method to partially fund the payment, the fee will be pro-rated.
